# Dogecoin-USD Data Engineering Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook documenting the data engineering project focused on analyzing the historical Dogecoin-USD data.

## Project Overview

The project aims to explore, preprocess, and model the Dogecoin-USD time series data to analyze its trends and potentially create predictive models.

## Files

- `Dogecoin_ML_Model_and_Prediction`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire data engineering pipeline.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtained historical Dogecoin-USD data from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned data, handled missing values, and performed necessary transformations.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored statistical summaries and visualized data patterns.
4. **Model Building**: Implemented various models (e.g., GRU) for time series analysis and prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and RMSE.
6. **Documentation**: Prepared comprehensive documentation including explanations, code comments, and insights.

## How to Use

- Ensure Python and necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, TensorFlow) are installed.
- Open the `Dogecoin_Data_Engineering.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Usage Notes

- All code is properly commented and explained for better understanding.
- Feel free to experiment with different models, parameters, or analysis techniques.
